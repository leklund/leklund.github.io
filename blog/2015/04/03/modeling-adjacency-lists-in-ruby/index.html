<p>Normally, this would be a task I would try to keep in my data layer
since PostgreSQL is so great at doing this with recursive queries. However,
sometimes you just need to operate in Ruby and Ruby alone. Let&rsquo;s say I want to model
what I always call an adjacency list but what is more technically a a directed graph.
We have a set of nodes where any given node can have a parent node:</p>

<pre><code>1
</code></pre>

<p>   / \
  2   3</p>

<pre><code> / \
4   5
</code></pre>
