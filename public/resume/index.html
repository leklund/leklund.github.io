<h2>summary</h2>

<p>I am a Senior Software Developer with 9 years of solid experience with Ruby,
PostgreSQL, Javascript, Perl and a host of other technologies. My experience
covers the full stack of software development from the server layer, data
model, application layer, to the user interface. I&rsquo;m passionate
about building well-tested, quality software.</p>

<p>The first piece of software I ever wrote, in the sixth grade, was a graphical
adventure game set in the age of dinosaurs written in Applesoft BASIC. These
days I get excited about building scalable RESTful API&rsquo;s and responsive web
applications in Rails (and I still like dinosaurs).</p>
