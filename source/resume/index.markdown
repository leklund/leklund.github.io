## summary
I am a Senior Software Developer with 10 years of solid experience with Ruby,
PostgreSQL, MySQL, Javascript, Perl and a host of other technologies. My experience
covers the full stack of software development from the server layer, data
model, application layer, to the user interface. I'm passionate
about building well-tested, quality software.

The first piece of software I ever wrote, in the sixth grade, was a graphical
adventure game set in the age of dinosaurs written in Applesoft BASIC. These
days I get excited about building scalable RESTful API's and responsive web
applications in Rails (and I still like dinosaurs).
