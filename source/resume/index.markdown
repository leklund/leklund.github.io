## skills and tools

* I'm an efficient problem solver and skilled at troubleshooting. I'm also a self-starter and a fast learner -- I love learning new technologies and methodologies.
* Highly proficient in Ruby and Perl. I have some experience with Python and can read Java which I have done when developing in jRuby. I also have some PHP experience but would be happy if I never had to see it ever again.
* Editor of choice: vim.
* I'm quite skilled with SQL and have much experience with PostgreSQL, PostGIS, PL/pgSQL, PL/v8. This includes experience with large datasets (one table has over 7.5e8 rows).
  I've worked with MySQL but my preferred RDBMS is PostgreSQL.
* My current web development stack experience is mainly Ruby on Rails (3 & 4) or Sinatra + Sequel. I've also developed using the Perl-based Catalyst framework and HTML::Mason.
* Test framework: After a long on-again/off-again relationship with Cucumber and a torrid affair with rspec, I'm happily working with MiniTest and loving it.
* I'm also well-versed in JavaScript and CSS. I can write coffeescript but I prefer pure js.
* Some other tools in my kit: Redis, Google Maps API, Unicorn, Cloudfront + S3, nginx, Bootstrap, jQuery
