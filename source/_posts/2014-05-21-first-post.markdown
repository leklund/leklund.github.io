__Hello? Is this thing on?__

I was testing out Octopress and decided it was time to finally start a blog. No,
this won't be the realization of my imaginary blog about the art of the movie trailer.
This will be about my experiences with Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.
I hope that by documenting what I have learned that I can help others along they way. Plus, as I age and
my memory fails me I can just google for my old posts.
