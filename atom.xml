    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The custom CMS that we built for kaboom.org has to manage a lot of rewrite rules because the
information architecture keeps getting rejiggered. We were managing them with Rack::Rewrite
but I always hated having a huge stack of rewrites in the application.rb configuration. Since the app
is hosted Heroku there weren&rsquo;t really any other options until I realized that Phusion Passenger
will now run in standalone mode on Heroku.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite easy to get Passenger running on Heroku: <a href="https://github.com/phusion/passenger-ruby-heroku-demo">https://github.com/phusion/passenger-ruby-heroku-demo</a></p>

<p>replace the app server in your Gemfile (unicorn, thin, puma, etc) with</p>

<pre><code>gem 'passenger'
</code></pre>

<p>Update your Procfile</p>

<pre><code>web: bundle exec passenger start -p $PORT --max-pool-size 3
</code></pre>

<p>This works great but doesn&rsquo;t come with an obvious was to edit the nginx.conf to add rewrite rules or an include directive.
According to the <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Standalone.html#advanced_configuration">advanced configuration</a> section
of the Passenger standalone manual, we see that there is an option to pass a configuration template.</p>

<p>After adding Passenger to your Gemfile and running a <code>bundle install</code> tun this from you application root directory
to create a configuration template.</p>

<pre><code>cp $(passenger-config about resourcesdir)/templates/standalone/config.erb config/nginx.conf.erb
</code></pre>

<p>You could just add rewrites to this file but because the default configuration template may change from time to time
I would recommend adding any custom configuration to another file. Just after the <code>server {</code> line add</p>

<pre><code>include '&lt;%= app[:root] %&gt;/config/nginx_custom_config.conf';
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using this to perform rewrites and you are running on Heroku, this needs to be included</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% if app[:environment] != 'development' %&gt;
  port_in_redirect off;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Because Nginx is listening on the random port assigned by the Heroku routing layer Nginx will, by default, include this port
number in the rewrite rules that do HTTP redirects. The conditional makes sure that when running on localhost:5000 redirects still work as intended in your development environment.</p>

<p>Other use cases include enforcing SSL on your app, adding HTTP basic auth to an app, and easier generation of CORS headers.
So far I&rsquo;m loving Phusion Passenger standalone on Heroku. In a future post I plan to examine the performance and memory usage
versus the existing Unicorn setup.</p>

    <id>http://code.eklund.io/blog/2015/01/29/autoscaling-resque-workers-on-heroku-with-platform-api</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Heroku is a great service and is extremely powerful. It&rsquo;s also not cheap so leaving workers idling can cost you a lot of money.
If you have background workers that do variable amounts of work it makes sense to scale up the number of workers as new jobs
are queued and then scale back down as the queue clears.</p>

<p>Here is how one might scale workers using <a href="https://github.com/resque/resque/blob/master/docs/HOOKS.md">resque hooks</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/heroku/platform-api">Heroku platform-api</a> gem.
This example scales up a worker for every three pending jobs. It will scale down once the queue is empty and
all the workers are finished. It will also scale down when the number of idling dynos is greater than 5.
Because it is not possible to control which dynos are killed off, this assumes that your resque workers are handling TERM
signals (and hopefully the jobs are idempotent). It is likely that the downscale could kill off working dynos so the jobs so be sure
to handle the Resque::TermException for jobs.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Careful With Those Inflectors: A Tale of Performance Tuning Rails]]></title>
    <link href="http://code.eklund.io/blog/2014/08/12/careful-with-those-infelectors/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-12T16:48:19-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://code.eklund.io/blog/2014/08/12/careful-with-those-infelectors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We run our website at kaboom.org on a custom-built Rails 4-based CMS and for a long
time I was unhappy with performance of the site. Not that it wasn&rsquo;t responsive and
a huge (and I mean HUGE) improvement over the previous drupal mess, but requests
were spending more time than seemed necessary just in the ruby layer. Most requests were spending
almost 500ms there according to NewRelic traces.</p>

<p>I installed some tools locally to help track down where and why it was spending
so much time each request. The gem <a href="https://github.com/MiniProfiler/rack-mini-profiler">rack-mini-profiler</a> got me started and it is
a great way to get data on each and every request.
This helped me track down some code that was dynamically creating <code>store_accessors</code> for every request. There is an easy way to check if a
given <code>stored_attribute</code> exists on a class:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Post.stored_attributes[:options].include?("some_attribute")</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Implementing this check and only adding the store_accessors when needed
provided a small performance increase but each request was still spending way
too much time in ruby. I spent some time trying to get usable data from
flamegraphs and also experimented with adding &lsquo;step&rsquo; blocks in my code to help
track down where things were slow. The problem I found with rack-mini-profiler
was that the rails stack is so deep it makes it very hard to see exacty where
the problems are. I still have it installed on a local branch that and I find
it very useful in some cases. But for this issue, it left me digging through a
convoluted flame graph and I decided to move on.</p>

<p>It was at this point I took a few weeks off from profiling and also took a
vacation. Several weeks later I was preparing for a bug day and was getting
error traces from New Relic to add to Trello that I revisited the performance
issues.  We are on Heroku so I decided to switch our free New Relic plan to the
plan the provides the paid-level features for a limited number of dynos. What
this gave me was access to my new favorite profiling tool: the New Relic thread
profiler. I ran the tool for a 5 minute trace and this was the result:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://code.eklund.io/images/blog/newrelicprof.png"></p>

<p>I had to uncollapse a few parts of the tree but it&rsquo;s pretty clear that the
request was spending over 56% of the time in the name method on the
ContentField model. Which, as it turns out, was a method that was no longer
even needed.
The offending, extraneous code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">name</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">super</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="k">super</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">nil?</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="k">super</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">blank?</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">super</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">downcase</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parameterize</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">underscore</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I think this was added in the initial phases of building our CMS to ensure
conformity with seeded names alongside imported field names from Drupal. The
drupal importer I wrote handled all the transformations and there are
validations so enure that field names are created properly. This method does
nothing at all except run downcase, parameterize, and underscore on strings
that already conform to that format. And, as it turns out, <em>inflectors don&rsquo;t
come cheap</em>. I removed the method, ran my tests, and deployed a new version of
the CMS. The performance increase was noticable immediately:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://code.eklund.io/images/blog/transaction_performance.png"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not everyday that removing 4 lines of code (well, it was really just one) can give you such a boost in performance. Lessons learned:</p>

<ol>
<li>Careful with those inflectors! They can end up being performance bottlenecks.</li>
<li>Just because it was cached in memcache doesn&rsquo;t mean the object initialization doesn&rsquo;t incur the same cost.</li>
<li>NewRelic thread profiling is pretty awesome</li>
<li>rack-mini-profiler combined with flame graphs is an incredible tool that I need to spend more time learning how to use properly.</li>
<li>Careful with adding dynamic stored attributes with an after_initialize. They get added as class methods so only need to be added once.</li>
</ol>

    <link href="http://code.eklund.io/blog/2014/05/27/ignoring-heroku-errors-on-rake-db-migrate/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-27T17:37:30-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://code.eklund.io/blog/2014/05/27/ignoring-heroku-errors-on-rake-db-migrate</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(Repurposing my answer to this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17300341/migrate-not-working-on-heroku/17306077">stackoverflow question</a> as a blog post)</p>

<p>If you are using Rails 4.x on Heroku and you have your schema format set to sql (which you probably should), you will see this error when running <code>heroku run rake db:migrate</code></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Aborted!
</span><span class='line'>Error dumping database
</span><span class='line'>.../activerecord-4.0.4/lib/active_record/tasks/postgresql_database_tasks.rb:55:in `structure_dump'
</span><span class='line'>.../activerecord-4.0.4/lib/active_record/tasks/database_tasks.rb:143:in `structure_dump'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is an interesting bug that, as it turns out, can be ignored.</p>

<p>ActiveRecord will only run the task <code>db:structure:dump</code> if you are using &lsquo;sql&rsquo; as
your <code>active_record.schema_format</code>.  And that rake task (<code>db:structure:dump</code>) will
fail on Heroku because the executable <code>pg_dump</code> is (unsurprisingly) not in the
binary path.  Interestingly enough, Heroku states that <code>db:schema:dump</code> is not
supported but if you set the schema format to ruby, it works fine. Of course,
you would end up with a <code>schema.rb</code> file on one-off dyno that will not exist
shortly after the rake task finished running.</p>

<p>In Rails 3, the dump task would only raise an error is the exit code of the
command was 1. On unix based systems if a command is not found, the exit code
is 127.  So even if the <code>pg_dump</code> command fails on Rails 3 (which it does), it
won&rsquo;t raise an error and it won&rsquo;t halt the rake task. So anyone using a sql
schema format with Rails 3 wouldn&rsquo;t have this issue because it would fail
silently. The code was refactored in Rails 4 to properly raise an error if the dump failed.
This means that <code>db:migrate</code> will raise an error on Heroku.</p>

<p><strong>However, even though it errors with rake aborted the DDL from the migration is actually executed and committed.</strong></p>

<p>Here are some possible solutions (if the error really bothers you):</p>

<ul>
<li>Ignore the error as the migrations are actually running.</li>
<li>Since you don&rsquo;t care about the structure dump on production, set the schema_format to ruby. In config/environments/production.rb:</li>
</ul>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>If for some reason you don&rsquo;t want to change the config file: add a rake task with the following to suppress the error:</li>
